This project focuses on transforming a raw, unstructured dataset into a clean and interactive analytical dashboard using Power BI. The goal was to make the dataset visualization ready and generate meaningful business insights that can support data-driven decision-making.

The workflow began with data presentation in Power Query . Multiple cleaning steps were performed such as delete unnecessary columns, handling missing values.
After cleaning, relationships were structured to build an efficient data model. Several calculated columns and DAX measures were created to analyze performance metrics like total sales, total quantity, transactions, average.

The dashboard was then designed to be simple, readable, and recruiter-friendly. It includes interactive visuals such as pie chart, slicer, azure maps, table, clustered bar chart, funnel, area chart, line chart.     Formatting techniques like rounded bars, consistent color usage, and structured layout were applied to improve user experience and storytelling.

Key Highlights:

1) Built an end-to-end Power BI dashboard for mobile sales analysis, converting raw data into actionable business insights.
2) Cleaned, transformed, and modeled data using Power Query, improving data quality and reporting accuracy.
3) Created DAX measures and KPIs to track total sales, revenue trends, quantity sold, and top-performing products.
4) Designed interactive dashboards with slicers and visuals to enable data-driven decision-making for stakeholder.
